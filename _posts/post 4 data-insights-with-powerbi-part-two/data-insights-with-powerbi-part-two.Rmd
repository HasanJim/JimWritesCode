## Overall Insights

1. Total Revinue $4.69M,
which fails to meet the target of $8m.

2. Total number of customer is 700 which is less than the half of the target.

3. Most of the profit comes from the Chocolate Chips cookie, nearly 37% of the total profit.

4. Fortune cookie has the lowest sales all over the year. Need to revise the decision whether to continue it or not.
